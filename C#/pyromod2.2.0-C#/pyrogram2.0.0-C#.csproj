        <Description>
            A monkeypatcher add-on for Pyrogram which does conversation handling and other cool stuff.
            In other words, it is a compilation of utilities i developed for improving my personal experience with Pyrogram.
            It works **together** with Pyrogram, it is **not** a fork/modded version. It does monkeypatching to add features to Pyrogram classes on the go (so i don't need to update on every Pyrogram's release).
